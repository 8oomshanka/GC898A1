# Lunar Lander

HTML5/JS (ES6) "Lunar Lander" game. Pilot a lunar module down the the surface of the moon, firing the boosters as necessary (touch screen, hold mouse button, or depress any key) to touch down at a safe speed of 4 m/s or less without running out of fuel. Fuel represents about half of the weight of the lunar module and so burning fuel reduces your inertia.

Many thanks to Dan-Q for writing the original programme and making it open source. For more details, see https://danq.me/2018/03/03/lunar-lander/.
